# Bluetooth_Forensics_Proj by Jatin Bhakta, Eric M. Lynn, and Chris Heisler

This is a visual display of data extracted from packets intercepted using Ubertooth technology.
Data packets were parsed into JSON format and are displayed on a webpage using JQuery.

To run this program in yoru browser, run a web server to host the files in this project on.
My personal favorite method of doing so is to run python from command line- 
python -m SimpleHTTPServer <port#>
